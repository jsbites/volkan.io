volkan.io
=========

Source Code for http://volkan.io/

Why:

I've put a quick and dirty design for volkan.io, which I believe can be better.

Since volkan.io is kind of my web "about me" business card, it should be in a more "finished" state.

I plan to use, more media queries and RWD, and less JavaScript.

This is in my TODO list along with many other things, like finalizing version 1 of http://o2js.com/interview-questions/ --
so I don't know when I'll have chance to work on this... sooner than later is better...

Credits:

The current template is a derived from AJ's HTML5 Miniport 2.0
( n33.co @n33co dribbble.com/n33 )

I also plan to change the template and create something from scratch
using a css-only templating framework (bootstrap maybe, or something lighter)
Because I don't like the template's current approach to use JavaScript to adjust the display. / CSS media queries should have been used for that instead.

Anyways, it's in my to-do list, too.

We'll see.
